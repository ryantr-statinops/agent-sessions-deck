# Quant router

| Need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Alpha, backtesting, or model evaluation research | [research](research/SKILL.md) |
| Research-to-production engineering workflow | [production-workflow](production-workflow/SKILL.md) |
| Time-series foundations | [statistics](../statistics/SKILL.md) |

This category is engineering and research guidance, not financial advice or trade authorization. Production workflow guidance must stop at system design, monitoring, and human approval boundaries.
