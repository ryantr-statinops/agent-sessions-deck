# Data engineering router

Use this router when the primary artifact is a data pipeline, storage design, or its scheduled operation.

## When not to use
Do not use it for statistical interpretation without an engineering artifact, or for an API service whose data layer is incidental; route those to `personal/statistics` or `personal/engineering/backend`.

| Need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Ingestion and transformation | [pipelines](pipelines/SKILL.md) |
| Storage and query design | [databases](databases/SKILL.md) |
| Scheduling and operations | [orchestration](orchestration/SKILL.md) |
| Data engineering foundations | [core](core/SKILL.md) |

Prefer the smallest reliable local design before introducing distributed infrastructure.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Route a task to the narrowest child skill listed by this router.
- Do not activate when: Do not activate when the task is outside this category or no child boundary matches.
- Expected output: Name the selected child skill(s), reason, and any supporting route.
- User-facing report: Summarize the route, excluded children, loaded resources, and validation.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
