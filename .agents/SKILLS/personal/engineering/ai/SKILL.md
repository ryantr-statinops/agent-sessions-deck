# AI engineering router

Use this router when a model, retrieval component, tool, or agent is part of the user-facing outcome. Load `core` first for problem framing, model/system boundaries, evaluation, and production constraints.

## When not to use
Do not use for ordinary software with no AI system boundary, or for a standalone data analysis whose output does not depend on a model or agent.

| Need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| AI/ML/LLM/agent foundations and system design | [core](core/SKILL.md) |

Detailed RAG, agent, MCP, MLOps, and model-specific skills may be added later. Until then, keep their shared decision rules in `core` and do not invent a narrower route.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Route a personal AI engineering task to `core` when it involves model, data, LLM, agent, tool, evaluation, or production decisions.
- Do not activate when: Do not use for ordinary software work with no AI system boundary.
- Expected output: Name the relevant AI system boundary, route to `core`, and identify any future specialized skill that is not yet available.
- User-facing report: Summarize the selected foundation, assumptions, evaluation plan, and unresolved production risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
