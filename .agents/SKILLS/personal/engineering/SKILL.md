# Engineering router

Use for engineering decisions that should reflect Ryan's preferences. Start with `core` when the task involves shared computational or systems reasoning, then route to exactly one narrowest domain or implementation skill.

## When not to use
Do not use this router for a generic engineering question with no personal preference or project context; use the matching `common/` skill directly.

| Need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Algorithms, optimization, or systems foundations | [core](core/SKILL.md) |
| Go, Python, or Node.js backend | [backend](backend/SKILL.md) |
| Data pipelines or storage | [data](data/SKILL.md) |
| AI and agent engineering | [ai](ai/SKILL.md) |
| Linux, Docker, or networking | [infrastructure](infrastructure/SKILL.md) |
| Lightweight web UI | [frontend](frontend/SKILL.md) |

Keep generic engineering guidance in `common/` and personal preferences here.

Choose `core` for algorithms or systems foundations, then choose one child for the concrete language, data, AI, infrastructure, or UI boundary. Keep sibling routes out unless the task explicitly spans them.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Route a task to the narrowest child skill listed by this router.
- Do not activate when: Do not activate when the task is outside this category or no child boundary matches.
- Expected output: Name the selected child skill(s), reason, and any supporting route.
- User-facing report: Summarize the route, excluded children, loaded resources, and validation.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
