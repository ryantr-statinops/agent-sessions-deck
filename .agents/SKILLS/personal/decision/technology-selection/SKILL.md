# Technology selection

## When to use
Use when choosing a language, framework, database, service, or tool for a personal project.

## Personal principles
Prefer tools that are understandable, testable, and maintainable by one person.

## Workflow
1. Define workload, constraints, lifecycle, and success criteria.
2. Compare viable candidates against weighted criteria.
3. Identify operational cost, lock-in, and learning cost.
4. Choose a default and define a reconsideration trigger.

## Decision rules
Do not choose popularity as a substitute for fit.

## Constraints
Separate current needs from speculative scale.

## Failure modes
If criteria are missing, return the decision questions before recommending a tool.

## Expected output
Provide candidates, criteria, trade-offs, recommendation, and revisit trigger.

## Validation
The choice is explainable against requirements and can be tested with a small spike.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use when the requested outcome matches this skill description and workflow.
- Do not activate when: Do not activate when the task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable artifact, decision, or result described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
