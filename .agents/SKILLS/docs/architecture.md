# SKILLS architecture

`SKILLS` is a portable Agent Skill Library. Its architecture separates
capability content from discovery, integration, and quality lifecycle tooling.

## Skill library

Every skill is a directory with a required `SKILL.md`. Optional
`references/`, `scripts/`, `examples/`, or `assets/` directories are created
only when the skill has real supporting content. The portable entrypoint keeps
the capability, boundaries, workflow, decisions, failure modes, output, and
validation close together.

- `common/` contains reusable engineering, data, security, delivery, and agent
  workflows.
- `personal/` contains Ryan's workflow preferences and domain foundations. Its
  primary career axis is `engineering/core` plus Data, AI, and Backend
  Engineering cores; `statistics` supports those domains and `quant` focuses
  on research and production workflow.
- `meta/` contains guidance about the skill system itself.

The personal engineering hierarchy is intentionally layered:

```text
engineering/core
├── data/core
├── ai/core
└── backend/core

statistics ── supports data, AI, and quant reasoning
quant/research ── quant hypothesis and evaluation
quant/production-workflow ── research-to-production engineering
```

Language-specific backend skills, infrastructure, frontend, product, workflow,
and decision skills remain narrower implementation or operating routes. They do
not replace the shared engineering foundations.

Use `common/README.md`, `personal/README.md`, and `meta/README.md` as curated
category navigation. Use the generated global registry for complete discovery.

## Discovery and integration

The agent should discover the smallest relevant skill before loading full
instructions:

```text
user intent
  → AGENTS.md and applicable runtime guidance
  → optional local.md project state
  → generated index and candidate descriptions
  → router SKILL.md when a category has one
  → selected leaf SKILL.md
  → conditional references/scripts/assets
  → execution, validation, and report
```

`docs/skill-index.md` is human-readable. `data/skills.json` is the machine
registry. `docs/discovery.md` defines selection rules. `docs/integration.md`
defines copy, selected sync, runtime adapters, and Git subtree integration.

## Quality and lifecycle

Quality is layered:

1. Structural metadata, paths, links, and generated files are checked by the
   validator.
2. Representative and boundary cases are checked by the evaluation harness.
3. Regression tests protect the harness and deterministic tooling.
4. GitHub Actions runs the checks on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
5. Skill SemVer and repository release tags describe lifecycle and distribution.

The architecture is intentionally portable. Runtime-specific behavior belongs
in adapters or runtime notes, not in the portable meaning of a common skill.
