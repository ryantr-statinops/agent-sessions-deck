# Skill bundles

A bundle is a named, reviewed selection of skill IDs. It is a distribution
manifest, not a second copy of skill content.

## Registry contract

The source of truth is `data/bundles.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "bundles": [
    {
      "id": "feature-delivery",
      "description": "Build a feature through planning, implementation, testing, and review.",
      "scope": "universal",
      "runtime_target": "portable",
      "allow_deprecated": false,
      "skills": ["common/workflow/feature-delivery"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every bundle has a lowercase kebab-case `id`, a useful description, a scope,
the `portable` runtime target, an explicit deprecated-skill policy, and a list
of canonical skill IDs.

Universal bundles may contain only reusable skills. Personal bundles may add
`personal` skills but remain separate from universal distribution.

## Distribution behavior

Bundles are resolved by canonical skill ID. Sync copies each referenced skill
with its supporting resources while preserving the repository-relative layout.
It does not copy unrelated repository files.

Check mode must resolve and validate every bundle member without writing. A
normal sync reports existing target paths before replacing them. Deprecated
skills are rejected unless the bundle explicitly opts in with
`allow_deprecated: true`.

## Compatibility

Adding a bundle is additive. Removing or changing a member is a distribution
change and must be recorded in the changelog or release notes. Consumers that
need reproducibility should record the source commit or release tag together
with the bundle ID.

Promotion is tracked separately in `data/promoted.json`. A promoted skill must
be a member of at least one supported bundle, but not every bundle member is
promoted. This keeps experimental primitives available for deliberate use
without presenting the entire library as a stable default.
