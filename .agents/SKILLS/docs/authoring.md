# Skill authoring

Use this guide when creating or revising a skill in `SKILLS`.

## Start with the outcome

Describe the concrete task the agent should perform and the observable result.
Avoid creating a skill that is only a topic label such as `python` or `AI`.

## Required entrypoint

Every skill has a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter containing at least:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does and when it applies.
---
```

When one skill requires another, add an optional `requires` list containing
canonical IDs such as `common/engineering/testing`. The registry records these
dependencies and bundle validation resolves them transitively, rejects cycles,
and rejects missing resources.

The body should explain activation boundaries, scope, workflow, decision rules,
constraints, failure modes, and validation. Start from
`meta/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` and remove sections that do not add value.

## Supporting resources

- `references/`: detailed knowledge needed only for particular modes.
- `scripts/`: deterministic operations that materially improve reliability.
- `examples/`: demonstrations, fixtures, or evaluation cases.
- `assets/`: reusable templates and output artifacts.

Do not create empty directories, copy generic manuals, or duplicate the same
knowledge across the entrypoint and references.

## Classification

- Put broadly reusable procedures in `common/`.
- Put Ryan-specific preferences and workflows in `personal/`.
- Put skill-system procedures in `meta/`.

If a skill has both reusable and personal parts, keep the reusable procedure
separate from the preference-specific extension.

## Invocation

Every skill declares an `invocation` metadata value:

- `user` for explicit workflow entry points and side-effectful orchestration;
- `both` for skills that users may select or agents may discover automatically;
- `model` only when automatic agent selection is intentional and explicit.

A user-invoked skill may direct the agent to read a `both` skill, but should not
silently delegate to another user-invoked workflow. Invocation metadata is
portable and must not contain runtime-specific plugin or slash-command rules.

## Before committing

1. Check the activation and exclusion boundaries.
2. Link every supporting resource from the relevant instruction.
3. Run `python3 scripts/validate_skills.py`.
4. Test one representative task and one nearby boundary task.

Do not make activation claims that only repeat the generic handoff template.
State the concrete outcome that selects this skill and the nearby outcome that
belongs to a different route.
