# Evaluation harness

The repository evaluation harness is intentionally lightweight. It checks that
every common and personal skill has a valid representative case, boundary case,
required observable fields, and a skill ID present in the generated registry.
It does not claim to score an agent's reasoning. The observable workflow cases
in `tests/fixtures/observable-agent-evaluations.json` additionally verify the
required terms in all four workflow representative and boundary artifacts.
Codex Action reports are evidence from a configured run, not a substitute for
these deterministic checks.

## Current commands

```bash
python3 scripts/run_evaluations.py
python3 scripts/run_evaluations.py --format json
python3 scripts/run_evaluations.py --output /tmp/skill-evaluation.md
python3 scripts/check_observable_evaluations.py --format json
```

The default output is Markdown. JSON is intended for CI and later tooling.
Validation commands declared by a case are rejected unless they exactly match
the allowlist in the script. Allowlisted commands are skipped by default and
can be explicitly enabled with `--run-commands`.

## Extension checklist

Future harness work should be added in this order:

- [ ] Runtime adapter that runs a representative task in a disposable fixture.
- [ ] Human review form for routing, procedure, safety, and output quality.
- [ ] Stable scoring rubric separate from structural validation.
- [ ] Regression baseline for approved results and intentional changes.
- [ ] Failure capture that preserves logs without secrets or private data.
- [ ] Flaky-case classification, retry policy, and quarantine workflow.
- [ ] Runtime/version matrix for Codex and later adapters.
- [ ] Explicit timeout, network, filesystem, and mutation boundaries.

Do not add LLM self-grading or arbitrary command execution as a shortcut for
these controls. A future execution adapter must be allowlisted, isolated, and
reviewable.
