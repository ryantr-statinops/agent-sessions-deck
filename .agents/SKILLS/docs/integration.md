# Agent-driven integration

This guide explains how an agent can expose selected SKILLS capabilities to an
existing project or coding-agent runtime. The user provides the desired
outcome; the agent inspects the project, proposes the smallest integration,
performs authorized local changes, validates them, and reports the result.

For the repository model, read [architecture](architecture.md). For the
agent lifecycle, read [agent operating model](agent-operating-model.md).

## Agent integration flow

```text
user intent
  → inspect target project and runtime
  → detect instruction and skill directories
  → choose subtree, selected sync, or copy
  → show scope, conflicts, and side effects
  → request confirmation when required
  → integrate selected skills
  → validate links, metadata, and runtime layout
  → report files, checks, and unresolved risks
```

The agent should integrate the smallest useful set of skills. It should not
copy the whole library merely because the repository exists.

## Inspect before changing

From the SKILLS repository, inspect a target project without mutation:

```bash
python3 scripts/inspect_integration.py /path/to/project
```

The report identifies `.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, and `.claude/` paths,
existing `AGENTS.md` or runtime instruction files, existing skill roots,
conflicting paths, and recommended validation commands.

If the runtime is unknown, use `.agent/` as the portable baseline and record
the adapter assumption. A directory name alone does not prove that a runtime
will discover skills.

## Integration options

### Git subtree — recommended for a vendored library

Use a subtree when the target project should keep an integrated copy in its own
history:

```bash
git remote add skills https://github.com/ryantr-statinops/SKILLS.git
git fetch skills main
git subtree add --prefix=.agent/skills skills main --squash
```

For updates:

```bash
git fetch skills main
git subtree pull --prefix=.agent/skills skills main --squash
```

Review the diff, preserve project-specific instructions outside the subtree,
run source validation where available, and test one representative task before
accepting the update. Use a reviewed commit or release tag when the consumer
needs a reproducible snapshot.

Only use subtree push when the target intentionally contributes a portable
change back to SKILLS:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix=.agent/skills skills main
```

Never push project-only instructions, secrets, or private overrides back to the
public library.

### Selected sync — recommended for a small project scope

Validate a selected export before copying:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_skills.py --check /path/to/project/.agent/skills \
  common/engineering/git-workflow personal/workflow/project-init
```

After review, run the same command without `--check`. The helper preserves the
selected skill directory structure and copies supporting resources with it.
The agent must inspect existing target paths and report any overwrite before
syncing.

When the project needs a complete workflow, use a named bundle:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_skills.py --list-bundles
python3 scripts/sync_skills.py --bundle feature-delivery --check /path/to/project/.agent/skills
python3 scripts/sync_skills.py --bundle feature-delivery /path/to/project/.agent/skills
```

For the supported baseline, inspect `data/promoted.json` and record the source
commit or release tag alongside the selected bundle. Promotion is a support
boundary, not a second copy of the skill content.

Bundle sync validates every referenced skill and stops if any target path
already exists. It never overwrites a selected skill implicitly.

Every normal sync also writes `.skill-sync.json` (source, bundle, selected
skills, and per-file hashes) and `.skill-catalog.json` (the installed skill
metadata). Review a prospective change with `--check --update`; apply it with
`--update`. An update stops if a managed file was edited in the consumer, and
only replaces files after the complete new export has validated. The catalog is
the preferred discovery input inside the consumer.

### Direct copy or development symlink

Direct copy is appropriate for a one-time, small integration. A symlink can be
used during local skill development when the runtime supports it, but it is not
a portable distribution mechanism and should not be assumed in documentation.

## Runtime adapters

Keep portable skill content under the same internal layout and adapt only the
outer runtime directory:

```text
portable baseline: .agent/skills/
possible adapters: .agents/skills/, .codex/skills/, .claude/skills/
```

Runtime-specific notes, hooks, plugins, and always-on instructions belong in
the adapter or its instruction file. Do not rewrite a portable `SKILL.md` to
fit one runtime when the difference belongs in `AGENTS.md` or an adapter.

The repository can generate a native `.agents/skills/` adapter from an existing
`.agent/skills/` export. Adapter directory names encode the full source ID with
hyphens (for example `common-engineering-debugging`) so repeated leaf names do
not collide. The adapter keeps the portable source content and its relative
resources intact.

```bash
python3 scripts/export_runtime_adapter.py \
  /path/to/project/.agent/skills /path/to/project/.agents/skills
```

## Bringing in an existing skill

When a user provides a skill from another repository or an existing local
system, inspect it before copying:

1. Read its entrypoint, license, source references, scripts, and resource tree.
2. Check for secrets, private data, destructive actions, hidden dependencies,
   and runtime-specific assumptions.
3. Decide whether to copy, adapt, rebuild, or reject it using
   `meta/skill-intake/SKILL.md`.
4. Classify it as `common`, `personal`, or `meta`.
5. Normalize the frontmatter and portable body without copying generic
   textbook material.
6. Add representative and boundary evaluation cases.
7. Regenerate the registry and run the complete validation flow.

A one-file Markdown skill may only need metadata and boundary adaptation. A
complex skill with references, scripts, examples, or assets must preserve only
resources that are real, reviewed, and linked progressively.

## Post-integration validation

From the source repository, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skills.py
python3 scripts/generate_skill_index.py --check
python3 scripts/run_evaluations.py --format json
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
```

In the target project, verify that the runtime discovers the selected directory,
relative resources resolve, project instructions do not weaken skill boundaries,
and a representative task plus nearby non-activation task behave as expected.
