# Skill evaluation

Evaluation checks whether a skill improves agent behavior on realistic tasks,
not merely whether its Markdown looks complete.

## Minimum evaluation set

For every new or changed skill, define:

1. A representative task that should activate the skill.
2. A nearby boundary task that should not activate it.
3. Expected behavior and observable output.
4. Failure conditions and safe handling.
5. The validation command or review criteria.

The repository format for these cases is defined in the
[evaluation case contract](evaluation-contract.md). Common and personal
skills keep the case beside the skill in `examples/evaluation.md`.

## Evaluation levels

### Structural

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skills.py
```

This checks names, frontmatter, placeholders, resource directories, and local
Markdown links.

### Behavioral

Run the representative task with the skill available. Confirm that the agent
uses the intended procedure, loads only relevant resources, handles failure
conditions, and produces the expected result.

### Boundary

Run the nearby task that should not activate the skill. Confirm that the skill's
description and exclusions prevent misrouting.

## Regression practice

Keep useful evaluation cases when a skill is revised. A change to activation,
scope, procedure, or expected output should trigger the representative and
boundary checks again.

Fix the narrowest demonstrated problem. Do not add broad rules based on a
single speculative failure.

## Common skill evaluation

Each common and personal skill keeps its representative and boundary scenarios
in `examples/evaluation.md`. These scenarios test routing intent and expected
behavior; they are not a substitute for running the task in a real project.

For Codex, additionally verify that:

- `common/README.md` routes the task to the intended skill.
- `common/CODEX.md` is read as runtime guidance without leaking into portable skill semantics.
- The selected `SKILL.md` is loaded before conditional resources.
- The portable procedure still makes sense outside Codex.
