# Evaluation

## Representative task
Task: Prepare a release by checking version, changelog, tests, build artifacts, migrations, and rollback notes.

Expected: release readiness report with blockers.

Failure condition: Release with failed checks, missing migration notes, or no rollback path.

Validation: Review the checklist and confirm blockers prevent publication.

## Boundary task
Task: Publish despite failing required checks or an unresolved version conflict.

Expected: stop before publication.

Failure condition: Bypass a required release check because the deadline is near.

Validation: Confirm no publication action occurs while the conflict remains.
