# Research

## When to use
Use when answering a question requires gathering, comparing, or synthesizing external or repository evidence.

## Workflow
1. Define the question, scope, date sensitivity, and decision it informs.
2. Search primary and authoritative sources first.
3. Record claims with source evidence and separate fact from inference.
4. Synthesize findings, limitations, disagreements, and uncertainty.
5. State a recommendation only when the evidence supports one.

## Decision rules
- Prefer current primary sources for changing technical facts.
- Do not present an inference or opinion as an observed fact.

## Failure modes
If evidence is weak or conflicting, say so and explain what would resolve it.

## Expected output
Return findings, evidence, caveats, and a clearly labeled conclusion.

## Validation
Every material claim is traceable to evidence or explicitly labeled inference.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
