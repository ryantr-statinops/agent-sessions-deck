# Comparison

## When to use
Use when choosing between tools, libraries, frameworks, architectures, or approaches.

## Workflow
1. Define the decision, candidates, constraints, and weighted criteria.
2. Gather comparable evidence from authoritative sources.
3. Separate facts from judgment and expose important unknowns.
4. Present a concise comparison table and trade-offs.
5. Recommend an option tied to the stated priorities.

## Decision rules
- Do not declare a universal winner without a defined context.
- Penalize operational complexity, lock-in, and unverified assumptions.

## Failure modes
If candidates are not comparable, narrow the decision or state the mismatch.

## Expected output
Provide criteria, evidence, trade-offs, recommendation, and alternatives.

## Validation
The recommendation changes predictably when the priority or constraint changes.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
