# Schema validation

## When to use
Use when accepting, transforming, migrating, or publishing structured data.

## Workflow
1. Identify the authoritative schema and intended version.
2. Validate required fields, types, nullability, ranges, uniqueness, and relationships.
3. Separate schema errors from record-level quality errors.
4. Report all actionable failures without mutating the source.

## Decision rules
- Reject incompatible data at the boundary rather than corrupting downstream state.
- Treat schema changes as compatibility decisions, not incidental fixes.

## Failure modes
If no authoritative schema exists, generate an observed profile and mark it provisional.

## Expected output
Provide pass/fail status, violations, affected records, and compatibility impact.

## Validation
Validation is deterministic and can be rerun against the same input.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
