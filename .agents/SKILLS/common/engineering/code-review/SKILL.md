# Code review

## When to use
Use after an implementation exists and the requested outcome is an evidence-based review of its diff, patch, or pull request.

## When not to use
Do not use as the implementation workflow, and do not substitute it for a test plan when no change is ready to inspect.

## Workflow
1. Read the requested behavior and relevant surrounding code.
2. Inspect the diff for correctness, edge cases, errors, and unintended scope.
3. Check tests, contracts, security boundaries, and maintainability.
4. Report findings by severity with file and line evidence.

## Decision rules
- Prioritize concrete defects over style preferences.
- Report no issue when the evidence supports correctness; do not invent concerns.
- Choose this skill when findings, severity, and file-level evidence are the requested output.

## Failure modes
If context or tests are missing, state the review limitation explicitly.

## Expected output
Return actionable findings first, followed by residual risks and summary.

## Validation
Every finding has evidence, impact, and a clear remediation direction.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
