# Documentation

## When to use
Use when documenting setup, usage, behavior, architecture, APIs, changes, or decisions.

## Workflow
1. Identify the audience, task, and source of truth.
2. Lead with the outcome and provide the shortest useful path.
3. Include prerequisites, examples, limitations, and verification.
4. Link rather than duplicate detailed documentation.
5. Check commands, paths, links, and terminology.

## Decision rules
- Prefer runnable examples and observable claims.
- Document behavior and decisions, not implementation trivia that will drift.

## Failure modes
If behavior is uncertain, mark it as an assumption or verify the source first.

## Expected output
Produce documentation appropriate to its audience with clear next actions.

## Validation
A reader can follow the documented path and reach the stated result.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
