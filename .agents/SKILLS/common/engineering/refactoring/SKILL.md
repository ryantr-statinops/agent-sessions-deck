# Refactoring

## When to use
Use when structure, duplication, naming, or coupling makes safe change harder and externally visible behavior must stay the same.

## When not to use
Do not use for a new feature or a root-cause fix; route those through the relevant delivery or `debugging` workflow first.

## Workflow
1. Establish current behavior with tests or a reproducible example.
2. Identify one structural smell and define a small target.
3. Make incremental changes without mixing new behavior.
4. Run focused checks after each meaningful step.

## Decision rules
- Prefer small local improvements over speculative rewrites.
- Do not refactor code without a way to verify behavior.
- Choose this skill when the user asks for cleanup, decomposition, naming, or coupling reduction without a behavior change.

## Failure modes
If behavior changes unexpectedly, revert the smallest step and isolate the cause.

## Expected output
Describe structural improvement, preserved behavior, and verification.

## Validation
Relevant tests pass and the diff contains no unrelated feature changes.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
