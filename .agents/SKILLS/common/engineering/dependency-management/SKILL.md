# Dependency management

## When to use
Use when changing package dependencies, lockfiles, runtime versions, or build inputs.

## Workflow
1. Inspect manifests, lockfiles, supported runtimes, and current usage.
2. Define why the dependency change is needed.
3. Check compatibility, license, security, transitive impact, and maintenance.
4. Make the smallest update and regenerate lock data with the project tool.
5. Run tests and build checks.

## Decision rules
- Prefer existing dependencies when they already solve the need.
- Keep lockfiles synchronized and never silently upgrade unrelated packages.

## Failure modes
If a version cannot satisfy constraints, report the conflict and alternatives.

## Expected output
Report dependency rationale, version impact, checks, and residual risk.

## Validation
Manifest and lockfile agree, installation is reproducible, and relevant checks pass.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
