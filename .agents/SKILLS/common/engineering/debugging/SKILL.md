# Debugging

## When to use
Use when behavior is failing, inconsistent, unexpected, or difficult to explain and the next step is a root-cause investigation.

## When not to use
Do not use for a planned feature whose behavior is not yet implemented; use the relevant delivery workflow. Do not use for behavior-preserving cleanup; use `refactoring`.

## Workflow
1. Capture the exact symptom, environment, and reproduction.
2. Reduce the failure to the smallest useful case.
3. Form and test evidence-based hypotheses.
4. Fix the root cause with the smallest safe change.
5. Add or update a regression check and verify the original reproduction.

## Decision rules
- Change one relevant variable at a time when isolating a cause.
- Prefer evidence from logs, tests, and minimal reproductions over speculation.
- Choose this skill when the task needs reproduction, isolation, or competing hypotheses before the fix is known.

## Failure modes
If reproduction is unavailable, document uncertainty and add observability before guessing.

## Expected output
Explain symptom, root cause, fix, verification, and remaining limitations.

## Validation
The original failure no longer reproduces and relevant regression checks pass.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
