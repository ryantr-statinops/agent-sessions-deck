# Testing

## When to use
Use when a behavior or contract needs deliberate coverage, including success, boundary, invalid, or regression cases.

## When not to use
Do not use as the primary route for finding an unknown root cause; use `debugging`. Do not use it to coordinate a multi-step feature; use the delivery workflow and load this skill for its test step.

## Workflow
1. Identify the behavior and its public contract.
2. Choose focused unit, integration, or end-to-end coverage.
3. Cover success, boundary, invalid, and failure cases.
4. Run the smallest relevant checks, then the broader suite when justified.
5. Investigate failures instead of weakening assertions.

## Decision rules
- Test observable behavior rather than implementation details.
- Prefer deterministic, fast tests for repeated feedback.
- Choose this skill when the requested outcome includes a test plan, test changes, or an explicit coverage decision.

## Failure modes
Do not report success when tests were skipped, flaky, or unrelated to the changed behavior.

## Expected output
Report tests run, results, coverage of risk, and known limitations.

## Validation
The new or changed behavior has a passing test and an appropriate boundary case.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
