# Context loading

## When to use
Use when a task spans many files, skills, references, or tools.

## Workflow
1. Identify the outcome and immediate unknowns.
2. Read instructions, entrypoints, schemas, and tests first.
3. Select the narrowest relevant skill and load only conditional resources.
4. Summarize evidence and expand context only for a concrete unresolved question.

## Decision rules
- Prefer primary artifacts over summaries.
- Do not load an entire category when one skill answers the task.

## Failure modes
If context is insufficient, name the missing artifact or decision instead of guessing.

## Expected output
Maintain a task-focused context map and an explicit list of assumptions.

## Validation
Every loaded resource supports a stated decision, action, or verification.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
