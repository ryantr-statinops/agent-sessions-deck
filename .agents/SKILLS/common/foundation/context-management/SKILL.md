# Context management

## When to use
Use when a repository, specification, or task has more context than the current work requires.

## Workflow
1. Identify the requested outcome and relevant subsystem.
2. Read `CONTEXT.md` when present, especially its vocabulary, architecture boundaries, test seams, constraints, and artifact paths.
3. Read entrypoints, instructions, schemas, and tests before deep implementation files.
4. Load references only when a decision requires them.
5. Keep a concise evidence summary and discard unrelated detail.
6. Re-check source files when assumptions become uncertain.

## Decision rules
- Prefer primary project artifacts over summaries.
- Expand context only in response to a concrete unknown or failure.
- Treat project-defined artifact paths as the source of truth; when they are
  absent, use `docs/agent/` with `specs/`, `diagnostics/`, `decisions/`,
  `reports/`, and `handoffs/` subdirectories.

## Failure modes
If context is insufficient, state exactly which artifact or decision is missing.
If `CONTEXT.md` is absent, continue with repository evidence and report the
default assumptions used for artifact paths and terminology.

## Expected output
Maintain a task-focused context map rather than a repository dump.

## Validation
Confirm that each loaded artifact supports a stated decision or verification step.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use the activation boundary and outcome described in this skill.
- Do not activate when: The task matches the stated exclusion or a narrower skill.
- Expected output: Produce the observable result and validation described by the workflow.
- User-facing report: Summarize scope, result, checks, and unresolved risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
