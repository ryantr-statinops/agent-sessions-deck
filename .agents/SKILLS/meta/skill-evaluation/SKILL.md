# Skill evaluation

## When to use

Use when reviewing a new or changed skill, diagnosing weak behavior, or deciding
whether a skill is ready to publish.

## Workflow

1. Choose one representative task and one boundary task.
2. Record the expected behavior, required artifacts, and validation signals.
3. Run the task with the skill available and inspect the actual output.
4. Check routing, procedure, decisions, failure handling, and context usage.
5. Record failures as a narrow change request; do not add broad rules without evidence.
6. Re-run the representative and boundary tasks after changes.

## Quality checklist

- The description activates for the intended task and excludes nearby tasks.
- The procedure is actionable without duplicating general model knowledge.
- References are loaded only when relevant.
- Scripts, if present, are deterministic and tested.
- The expected result and validation are observable.
- Failure modes lead to safe, useful behavior.

## Evaluation levels

- **Static:** structure, metadata, links, naming, and validator checks.
- **Manual:** realistic task and boundary-task review.
- **Regression:** repeat prior cases after a change.

Agent-based evaluation is optional; use it when the skill is complex enough that
independent behavioral review materially improves confidence.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: The task changes authoring, discovery, evaluation, intake, or maintenance of this skill library.
- Do not activate when: The task is domain implementation unrelated to the skill system.
- Expected output: Produce a bounded skill-system decision, artifact, or validation result.
- User-facing report: Summarize the rule applied, files or registry affected, checks, and risks.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive repository changes, external writes, or irreversible lifecycle actions.
